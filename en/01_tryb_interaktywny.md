# Chapter 1. Interactive mode

Workshops will start with an explanation of how we will program
In Python.

## We are starting!

Open [this link](https://repl.it/languages/python3) in a separate tab
browser.

If you see a window asking for an account, close it by clicking
In "x".

The page you see is divided into two parts:

* On the left, on a white background, is the **text editor**,
* On the right you see **interactive mode**.

The editor allows you to create the entire program code and then run it through
Press the "play" button (or the Ctrl + Enter key combination).
If the program writes some text, we will see it in the mode window
interactive.

Interactive mode works quite differently: waiting to enter a command,
And when you press enter, it executes and prints its result. In this way
You can program and immediately see the results.

Working with interactive mode is convenient when you want to test
Operation of a single operation or when you are not sure what operations
You want to perform. If you already know what program you want to write, then
It is easier to use the editor.

There is one more important difference between interactive mode and editor:
The interactive mode will always print the result after the operation. Editor
He will only do it if we give him such a command (through the instruction
`Print`, which we will talk about later).

So far, we will be using **interactive mode** as we will
They learned individual instructions and watched their results. Do not be afraid
Experiment with different variants of these commands, in the worst case
Python will tell you that the code you typed can not be executed.

## The prompt

In the code examples that you will find in subsequent chapters, many times
You will see the `>>>` string. This is a **prompt**. We use it to
Distinguish the text to be typed in interactive mode from the text that
The Python interpreter writes itself. If in some line of example
You will see the prompt, that is, everything that follows the character belongs
Type in interactive mode, then press Enter. The same sign
We do not enter!

##:pushpin: summary

In this chapter:

* We opened the page `repl.it`, which we can program in the editor
Or **interactive mode** Python,
* We learned how the **prompt** looks and shows us the code,
Which should be entered in interactive mode.
